# next-image-converter

This is an image converter that can be used to optimize images after completing the project
instead of individually converting files

```python
pip install pillow
```

Place the `main.py` file in the root of the project and execute
all the `.jpg`,`.jpeg`,`.png` gets converted into `.webp`
